My name is Ludvig Daae Bj√∏rndal. I am a trained clinical psychologist (Cand. Psychol.) and researcher (PhD).

I am really interested in why some people develop mental health problems and what can be done to alleviate these. The primary focus of my research is how environmental factors shape risk of mental disorders in young people and adults. In addition, I have a keen interest in how to understand mental health beyond diagnostic systems and sum scores of individual symptoms.

Here, [I share all of my research](research.qmd) and [academic CV](cv.qmd). [I also have a blog](https://ludvigdb.substack.com) where I spotlight what I perceive as important new research in the mental health field and also some of my own work. You can also read more about me on my [academic website (University of Oslo)](https://www.sv.uio.no/psi/english/people/academic/ludvigdb/index.html).

I am affiliated with the [PROMENTA Research Center](https://www.sv.uio.no/promenta/english/index.html) (University of Oslo) and the [PsychGen Centre for Genetic Epidemiology and Mental Health](https://www.fhi.no/en/me/the-psychgen-centre-for-genetic-epidemiology-and-mental-health/) (Lovisenberg Diaconal Hospital and Norwegian Institute of Public Health).
