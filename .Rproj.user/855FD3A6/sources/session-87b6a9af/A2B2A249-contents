We have a new paper published in JAMA Network Open \[URL\] today which I am very excited to share. This work stems from when I was a Visiting Researcher at Karolinska Institutet in 2024.

Here, we leverage the unique Swedish population register data to study the long-term effects of childhood bereavement on risk of psychiatric disorder. Furthermore, we aim to shed light on the role of stress resilience in this relationship.
